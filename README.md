## Findings🧐
* Mountain, road, and touring bikes were the most lucrative product sub-categories.
* The United States raked in over $9.39 million, while Canada lagged behind at $1.97 million.
* 2021 was the goldmine year, with revenue hitting $365K and profits at $153K. while the lowest was in 2022 (only Q1 figures).
* Customers with 🎓 Bachelors' degrees, in 📊 Professional positions, earning $60K, and owning a 🏡 house were our revenue drivers.
* Those with only a Partial High school degree, in Management positions, earning $160K, and house owners didn't pull their weight.

## Recommendations💡
* 🚀 Boost production and marketing of the top revenue-generating product categories (🚴 Bikes, especially mountain, road & touring) and bundle them with accessories for maximum sales & profit.
* Focus on replicating the profitable US & Australian marketing strategies in the least revenue-generating countries (Canada, France, Germany & the United Kingdom).
* Incentives and rewards should be given to top-performing customers to encourage more sales. They can also conduct capacity-building sessions to mentor low-performing customers 
  on effective strategies to improve sales.
* Owning a house may be a more important priority to customers driving the least revenue than buying a bike, despite the fact they earn a high yearly income. 
  Targeted marketing of these groups of customers, educating them on the usefulness of bikes for physical activity, and improved health outcomes is key.
